# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator project built using React. It allows you to generate passwords with varying lengths, ranging from a minimum of 8 characters to a maximum of 100 characters. You can make the generated passwords strong by including numbers and special characters. Additionally, there is a convenient copy button that allows you to quickly copy the generated password to your clipboard.

## Features

- Generate passwords with lengths between 8 to 100 characters.
- Create strong passwords with numbers and special characters.
- Copy generated passwords to the clipboard with a single click.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed to learn and practice various React hooks, including:

- `useCallback()`: Used to memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- `useEffect()`: Used to handle side effects, such as updating the password.
- `useRef()`: Used to create a reference to the password input field for easy copying.
